# Development

## VSCode Development Environment

We've streamlined the VSCode dev container setup to be dead simple. One command gets you a fully configured development environment with automated bench setup:

```bash
# Create environment with automated setup script
cd deploy/
./dev_mmp_stack.sh init my-project --with-mmp
code ../development/my-project/frappe_docker/

# In VSCode: "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container" 
# (Explorer will be empty initially - this is normal!)
# Then run in terminal:
cd development && ./setup-bench.sh
```

This gives you the proven VSCode workflow with zero configuration hassle and one-command bench setup.

### Development Environment Options

```bash
# Standard development setup
./dev_mmp_stack.sh init my-project                    # Frappe + ERPNext

# MMP development  
./dev_mmp_stack.sh init mmp-dev --with-mmp             # Include MMP Core

# Custom configuration
./dev_mmp_stack.sh init client-app --site-name client.localhost --frappe-version version-14

# Frappe only (no ERPNext)
./dev_mmp_stack.sh init frappe-only --no-erpnext
```

### Development Workflow Benefits

- **Automated setup**: Custom `setup-bench.sh` script for one-command bench initialization
- **Configuration-aware**: Setup script customized based on your choices (ERPNext, MMP Core, site name)
- **VSCode-first**: Proven workflow with dev containers
- **Git-centric**: Custom apps pushed to GitHub, then included in builds
- **Environment isolation**: Dev environments in `../development/` to keep repo clean
- **Flexible**: Automated script for speed, manual instructions for learning

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

- **Docker** and **docker-compose**
- **VSCode** with [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- **User added to Docker group**
- **Memory allocation**: Allocate at least 4GB of RAM to Docker.
    - [Windows instructions](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#resources)
    - [macOS instructions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac/#advanced)

## Manual Development Setup

### Setting Up Frappe Development Containers

1. **Clone and navigate to the Frappe Docker repository**:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/frappe/frappe_docker.git
   cd frappe_docker
   ```

2. **Configure development container**:
   - Copy the example devcontainer config:
     ```shell
     cp -R devcontainer-example .devcontainer
     ```
   - Copy VSCode config for debugging:
     ```shell
     cp -R development/vscode-example development/.vscode
     ```

### Using VSCode Remote Containers

1. **Set up the database**:
   - By default, MariaDB is used. To switch to PostgreSQL, edit `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` to uncomment the `postgresql` service and comment out `mariadb`.

2. **Open Frappe Docker folder in a container**:
   - In VSCode, run: `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container` from Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).

### Initial Bench Setup

Run these commands in the container terminal. Make sure the user is **frappe**.

1. **Initialize the bench**:
   ```shell
   bench init --skip-redis-config-generation --frappe-branch version-15 frappe-bench
   cd frappe-bench
   ```

2. **Set up hosts**:
   ```shell
   bench set-config -g db_host mariadb
   bench set-config -g redis_cache redis://redis-cache:6379
   bench set-config -g redis_queue redis://redis-queue:6379
   bench set-config -g redis_socketio redis://redis-queue:6379
   ```

3. **Edit Procfile for Redis containers**:
   ```shell
   sed -i '/redis/d' ./Procfile
   ```

### Creating a New Site

1. **Create the site**:
   ```shell
   bench new-site --no-mariadb-socket development.localhost
   ```

2. **Enable Developer Mode**:
   ```shell
   bench --site development.localhost set-config developer_mode 1
   bench --site development.localhost clear-cache
   ```

### Installing Apps

1. **Fetch and install apps**:
   ```shell
   bench get-app --branch version-15 erpnext 
   bench --site development.localhost install-app erpnext
   ```

### Starting Frappe

1. **Run Frappe**:
   ```shell
   bench start
   ```
   - Access Frappe at [http://development.localhost:8000](http://development.localhost:8000)
   - Login with user `Administrator` and the password set during site creation.

# Docker Image Building

Xpress provides a flexible Docker image building script that simplifies creating custom Frappe stacks. It features smart defaults with full flexibility when needed.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Standard build (Frappe + ERPNext)
cd deploy/
./build_mmp_stack.sh build

# Build and push to registry
./build_mmp_stack.sh build --push

# Build with SSL deployment
./build_mmp_stack.sh build --push
./deploy_mmp_local.sh deploy --ssl
```

## Build Options

**Smart Defaults:**
- **Default**: Frappe + ERPNext (what most developers need)
- **MMP developers**: Add `--mmp` flag for MMP Core integration
- **Base only**: Use `--base-only` for Frappe framework only

**Examples:**
```bash
# Standard builds
./build_mmp_stack.sh build                    # Frappe + ERPNext
./build_mmp_stack.sh build --tag stable --push

# MMP developers
./build_mmp_stack.sh build --mmp              # Adds MMP Core
./build_mmp_stack.sh build --mmp --tag production --push

# Custom apps
./build_mmp_stack.sh build --app github.com/user/hrms:v15 --tag hrms-stack
./build_mmp_stack.sh build --app user/app1:main --app user/app2:develop

# Advanced usage
./build_mmp_stack.sh build --config ./custom-apps.json --tag client-stack
./build_mmp_stack.sh build --registry ghcr.io/username --push
```

**Features:**
- Smart defaults without over-engineering
- Flexible app configuration via command line or JSON files
- Automatic image naming based on content
- Support for multiple registries (Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry)
- CI/CD ready with consistent command interface

**[See full documentation](deploy/README.md)**

# Deployment

## Local Development Deployment

The fastest way to get ERPNext running locally with improved password handling and SSL support:

```bash
# Quick start - deploys ERPNext v15 with HTTPS
cd deploy/
./deploy_mmp_local.sh deploy --ssl

# Access at https://mmp.local
# View credentials: ./deploy_mmp_local.sh show-secrets mmp-local
```

**Deploy with Custom Images:**
```bash
# Build and deploy in one workflow
./build_mmp_stack.sh build --mmp --push
./deploy_mmp_local.sh deploy mmp-custom mmp.local admin@mmp.local devburner/mmp-erpnext latest --ssl
```

**Features:**
- Improved password handling (no terminal exposure)
- SSL/HTTPS support with Traefik reverse proxy
- Automatic Docker and /etc/hosts setup
- Grafana integration for monitoring
- Complete lifecycle management
- Built on official Frappe easy-install.py
- Integration with custom Docker image builds

**[See full documentation](deploy/README.md)**

## Production Infrastructure

### AWS EC2 - Staging Environment
A cost-effective, single-instance deployment perfect for development and small-scale production.

**Quick Start**:
```bash
cd iac/aws/ec2/terraform/
./deploy-backend.sh
```

**Features**:
- Single EC2 instance with Docker Compose
- Automated SSL certificates with Let's Encrypt
- S3 backups with lifecycle policies
