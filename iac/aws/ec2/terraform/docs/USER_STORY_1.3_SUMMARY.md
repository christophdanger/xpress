# User Story 1.3: Self-Contained EC2 Instance - Implementation Summary

## Overview
User Story 1.3 implements a self-contained EC2 instance for the ERPNext staging environment. This builds on the solid foundation of User Stories 1.1 (remote state) and 1.2 (networking).

## Resources Created

### 1. Security Group (`aws_security_group.erpnext_sg`)
- **Name**: `xpress-erpnext-erpnext-sg`
- **Ingress Rules**:
  - SSH (port 22) - for administrative access
  - HTTP (port 80) - for web application access
  - HTTPS (port 443) - for secure web application access
- **Egress**: All outbound traffic allowed
- **VPC**: Attached to the main VPC from User Story 1.2

### 2. EC2 Instance (`aws_instance.erpnext`)
- **Name**: `xpress-erpnext-erpnext-instance`
- **Instance Type**: `t3.medium` (configurable via variable)
- **AMI**: Amazon Linux 2 (`ami-0c55b159cbfafe1d0`)
- **Network**: Deployed in public subnet with public IP
- **Storage**: 20GB encrypted gp3 root volume
- **User Data**: Basic system setup script for ERPNext preparation

## Configuration Details

### Variables Added
- `instance_type`: EC2 instance type (default: t3.medium)
- `root_volume_size`: Root EBS volume size (default: 20GB)
- `ami_id`: AMI ID for the instance (default: Amazon Linux 2)

### Outputs Added
- `instance_id`: EC2 instance ID
- `instance_public_ip`: Public IP address
- `instance_public_dns`: Public DNS name
- `security_group_id`: Security group ID

### User Data Script
The `scripts/user_data.sh` script provides:
- System package updates
- Docker and Docker Compose installation
- Basic utilities (curl, wget, git, htop, etc.)
- ERPNext directory structure creation
- Hostname configuration
- Logging setup

## Design Principles

### 1. **Focused Scope**
- Only includes resources directly needed for User Story 1.3
- No premature optimization or out-of-scope features
- Clean separation from previous user stories

### 2. **Security Best Practices**
- Encrypted EBS volumes
- Security group with specific port rules
- TODO: SSH access should be restricted to specific IPs in production

### 3. **Modularity**
- Clear separation between compute, networking, and state management
- Configurable via variables
- Consistent naming and tagging

### 4. **Minimal Dependencies**
- Uses static AMI ID to avoid permission issues
- Simple user data script focused on basic setup
- No complex IAM roles or policies (keeping it simple for now)

## Validation Status
- ✅ **Terraform Validate**: Configuration is valid
- ✅ **Terraform Plan**: Shows clean plan with 2 resources to be created
- ✅ **No Scope Creep**: Only includes EC2 and security group resources
- ✅ **Integration**: Properly uses VPC and subnet from User Story 1.2

## Next Steps (Future User Stories)
- IAM roles and policies for EC2 instance
- Key pair management for SSH access
- Application deployment automation
- Monitoring and logging setup
- Backup and recovery configuration

## File Structure
```
compute.tf                     # EC2 instance and security group
variables.tf                   # Added compute-related variables
outputs.tf                     # Added compute-related outputs
scripts/user_data.sh           # Instance initialization script
```

The implementation is clean, focused, and ready for deployment while maintaining the modular approach established in previous user stories.
