## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Patterns
1. **Standardized Infrastructure Access**: All workflows use Terraform outputs and AWS SSM
2. **Configuration Management**: GitOps approach with environment files in `~/gitops/`
3. **Container Orchestration**: Docker Compose with frappe_docker override files
4. **Security-First Design**: No SSH access, secrets management, SSL enforcement
5. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Health checks, status reporting, and alerting

### Key Technologies
- **GitHub Actions**: Workflow orchestration and automation
- **AWS SSM**: Secure instance access without SSH
- **Docker Compose**: Container orchestration with frappe_docker
- **Traefik**: Reverse proxy with automatic SSL/TLS
- **Let's Encrypt**: Automated SSL certificate provisioning
- **AWS S3**: Backup storage with lifecycle management
- **frappe_docker**: Production-ready Frappe/ERPNext containers

### Integration with Epic 1 Infrastructure
- Uses Terraform outputs for instance IDs and S3 bucket names
- Leverages IAM roles and security groups from Epic 1
