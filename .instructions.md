# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions for the xpress Project

## 1. Project Goal & Context

The project is named "xpress". Its primary goal is to create a simple, flexible, and powerful set of tools for deploying applications based on the Frappe Framework (like ERPNext). The target audience ranges from developers to less technical users, so clarity and ease of use are paramount.

## 2. Core Architectural Principles

When generating code, especially shell scripts, adhere to the following principles:

*   **Modularity is Key**: Avoid monolithic scripts. Break down complex operations into smaller, single-responsibility modules or functions. Each script/module should do one thing well.
*   **Extensibility First**: The architecture must be easy to extend. Always consider how a new deployment type (e.g., "distributed", "kubernetes") or a new feature could be added without requiring a major refactor.
*   **Separation of Concerns**: Strictly separate configuration logic from deployment logic. User-facing prompts or configuration file parsing should happen in dedicated modules, distinct from the modules that execute the deployment steps.
*   **Pluggable Components**: Treat infrastructure pieces like the database, reverse proxy (Traefik), and the Frappe application itself as "pluggable" components. The main script should be able to orchestrate which components to deploy based on the chosen deployment type.

## 3. Deployment Script Structure

For deployment scripts, follow this established pattern:

*   **Main Orchestrator (`install.sh`)**: A primary entry-point script that controls the overall flow. It should handle:
    *   Parsing command-line arguments.
    *   Running pre-flight checks.
    *   Calling modules in the correct order.
    *   Using a `case` statement to select the deployment path (e.g., `single_server`, `distributed_aws`).

*   **Modules Directory (`deploy/modules/`)**: Core logic should reside in numbered files within this directory. This enforces order and modularity.
    *   `00_preflight_checks.sh`
    *   `01_install_dependencies.sh`
    *   `02_gather_config.sh` (handles user input)
    *   `10_deploy_traefik.sh`
    *   `11_deploy_database.sh`
    *   `20_deploy_frappe.sh`

*   **Configuration**: Prefer using environment variables (e.g., sourced from a `.env` file) to pass configuration between modules, rather than hardcoding values.

## 4. Code Style & Language

*   **Language**: Use `bash` for deployment scripts to ensure maximum portability between Linux and macOS.
*   **Readability**: Generate clean, well-commented code. Use descriptive function and variable names.
*   **Safety**: Use `set -euo pipefail` at the beginning of scripts to make them more robust and fail predictably. Check for the existence of required commands before using them.

By following these instructions, you will help maintain the project's architectural integrity and make it easier to build upon in the future.
